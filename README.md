 This Weather app combines wide range of skills including working with HTML, CSS and JS. I needed to use all of them to build this project in React. That helped me to get alogn with the basis principles and the essentials for this framework.
The design is responsible and it's suitable for many divices. The functionality of the website imitates the behaviour of all modern weather apps. You can simply check the daily-forecast and other details in real-time for every city, town or country in the world!

# Knowledge stack: ⚛️ #
 ### Many core principles in React were applied as I have been developing this project.

 <p>
 ⚙️ Lets begin with the JSX syntax that is something specific for this framework.
Another crucial concept were the components. As I had already mentioned in the description I have used HTML, CSS and JS in the development process. <br/>
  
 🌀 The reason for this is that is exactly what React components are made of. Some of them have state and change dynamically on base on the extracted data. Other don't have state or are rendered conditionality, but in the end, props is what is making them reusable and quite useful <br/>

🔍 So where I have received this weather data from? The answer is - OpenWeatherAPI. For the RESTapi requests I have been using Axios which provides excellent opportunity to handle requests and their reponses.
