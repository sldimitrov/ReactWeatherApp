# Project Title: üå§Ô∏è
## `React Weather App`

# Description #
This Weather app combines wide range of skills including working with HTML, CSS and JS. I needed to use all of them to build this project in React. That helped me to get alogn with the basis principles and the essentials for this framework.<br>
The design is responsible and it's suitable for many divices. The functionality of the website imitates the behaviour of all modern weather apps. You can simply check the daily-forecast and other details in real-time for every city, town or country in the world! 

# Live demo of the functionality #

# Knowledge stack #
 ### Many core principles in React were applied as i have been developing this project. Lets begin with the JSX syntax that is something specific for this framework. Another crucial concept were the components. Some of which have state and change dynamically on base on the extracted data. Other were rendered conditionality is something that you do a lot when using React. So what where I got this weather data from üîç? The answer is - OpenWeatherAPI. For the API request i have been using axios which provides excellent opportunity to handle requests and their reponses. As I had already mentioned in the description I have used HTML, CSS and JS for the development of the website application. ‚öôÔ∏è
