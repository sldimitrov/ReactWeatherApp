 People nowadays can look straight in the future... You don't believe me? In order to knock you out I am presenting you my new project named React Weather App. My application allows you to predict the unpredictable and travel safely. Hourly-forecast with the essential data for the day is what I am offering you. The main purpose behind the project is my course work at Orbis and also to get familiar with JS framework, in my case with React.

## Deployment 🌞 
*For the deployment of my project I have decided to use Vercel. It helps us to share any github project on the web with ease. After all, testing is the main reason I am deploying mine so...*

## Knowledge stack: <⚛️/> 
 ### Many core principles in React were applied as I have been developing this project.
<img align="right" width="340" height="190" alt="react core concepts" src="https://github.com/sldimitrov/ReactWeatherApp/assets/135168991/7b864aeb-9cf4-49a4-905e-ec10290f2932" /> 
<p>
 ⚙️ Lets begin with the JSX syntax that is something specific for this framework.
Another crucial concept I have used in action are the components. They involve working with HTML, CSS and JS in order to being develop. <br/>
 🔍 So where I have received this weather data from? The answer is - OpenWeatherAPI. For the RESTapi requests I have been using Axios which 
 provides excellent opportunity to handle requests and their reponses.<br/>
 🌀 Some components have state and change dynamically. Other are rendered conditionality, but in the end, props is what is making them reusable and quite useful. In order to use my state across many components without prop-drilling I have used custom hooks and useContext to derive the state everywhere I need it. Other hooks that were implement in my project are useState, useEffect, useMemo and useCallback
 
 ### To sum up the tech-stack:
Core: `React, JavaScript, HTML` <br/>
Additional libraries: `Axios, Sass`
</p> 


## Setup / Installation: 💻 

### Install React Weather APP with npm

* First make sure that you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine.
* After that, `clone` the `repo` somewhere locally.
* Open it in your favourite `code editor` and type this in the terminal:

```bash
  npm install
```
*With this command you install all packages that you need to run the React project.*
* After the *node_modules* folder is being install type:
```bash
  npm start
```
